# Codex changes and cross-model handoff

This file tells Claude and future Codex sessions what Codex changed, why, and how it was checked. Git remains authoritative for exact diffs; `config/dev_changelog.json` remains the in-app user-visible history; `TODO.md` remains the backlog.

Maintenance rule: after each completed Codex task, prepend a dated entry to **Codex task history** after the commit exists. Include the final commit hash, user-visible result, non-obvious decisions, verification, and cache version for front-end work. Do not silently rewrite an earlier decision—add a newer entry explaining the change.

## Current architectural decisions from the Codex work

- Study decks use finishable frequency levels and stable, discrete study sets. Set identity is rank-based so changing Merge Lemmas or Cognates does not reshuffle the underlying set boundaries.
- The normal setup and active-study flow share radial pickers and a discrete progress rail. Partial level progress is visible, and study sets are intended to feel independently completable.
- Merge Lemmas is the user-facing name. It is off by default; Exclude Cognates is off by default.
- Artist corpus frequency excludes exact repeated lyric lines within each song. Lemma-mode card frequency and examples use the same pooled sibling basis.
- Card grammar uses separate POS pills, English morphology labels, POS-linked colour, pooled-form highlighting, and a grouped/linked card-back layout. Trivial plural and elision form metadata is suppressed on the back.
- SpanishDict sense menus for normal and artist modes share `pipeline/util_5c_spanishdict.py`; reverse-direction conjugation collisions such as `sea` are guarded there rather than patched only in a final deck.

## Open handoff notes

Captured from Josh on 2026-07-25; these are not yet implemented unless a later history entry says otherwise.

- Add section-vocalist attribution to lyric examples, prefer examples sung by the selected artist, then prefer examples with Spotify tracks, and down-rank remix/version titles.
- Extend LRCLIB timestamps with line end times and consider a sequential lyric-example autoplay mode.
- Make the settings gear open Account by default. Add clearly warned, persistent global defaults for Merge Lemmas and Exclude Cognates under Advanced.
- Move Speech versus Lyrics selection after language selection; Lyrics should then open the artist radial picker. Remove the landing-page top-bar mode switch.
- Ensure partial progress is shown on individual study-set choices as well as levels.
- Confirm/order artist vocabulary ties by corpus count, general Spanish frequency, then distinct song count. Exact repeated lines are already excluded from corpus count and distinct-song count is already present in step 7b; see the audit accompanying the next implementation task.
- Make English TTS speak the displayed inflected translation rather than the underlying infinitive gloss.
- Add free-text flag notes and make the primary flag target a sense–example pairing.

## Codex task history

### 2026-07-25 — Study feedback and progress surfaces

- Commit `e23684b`; front-end cache `flashcards-v79` / `20260725x`.
- Rebuilt the set-complete result around one contextual primary action plus restrained review and restart actions, with consistent typography and spacing.
- Made landing and in-set progress details explicit information-button actions, clarified weighted coverage in the all-time modal, and replaced ambiguous literal question marks with accessible information icons.
- Verification: JavaScript syntax checks, changelog JSON validation, cache-version search, and `git diff --check` passed; no browser preview was used because this repo's service worker makes it unreliable.

### 2026-07-25 — Account-first settings and persistent study defaults

- Commit `1ab5eeb`; front-end cache `flashcards-v78` / `20260725w`.
- Made the settings gear open Account rather than overriding the HTML state with Advanced.
- Added warned, device-wide defaults for Merge Lemmas and Exclude Cognates that apply to new Speech/Lyrics setups and refresh the current setup immediately.
- Exact saved-set resume continues to restore the saved set's own configuration.

### 2026-07-25 — Partial progress on study-set choices

- Commit `c118fdd`; front-end cache `flashcards-v77` / `20260725v`.
- Added proportional progress fill to every started-but-incomplete set cell, using the same percentage as the set detail and accessible label.
- Preserved the separate current-set focus ring, solid completed state, and unavailable state.

### 2026-07-25 — Inflected English text-to-speech

- Commit `b2672c5`; front-end cache `flashcards-v76` / `20260725u`.
- Routed English speech on flips, sense changes, grouped translations, and swipe navigation through the same conjugation-aware helper as the visible gloss.
- A surface such as `merezco` now displays and speaks “I deserve” instead of speaking the underlying infinitive “to deserve.”

### 2026-07-25 — Audited follow-up backlog

- Commit `cc0c8b0`.
- Captured Josh's settings, study-flow, progress, completion, artist-example, autoplay, ranking, TTS, and flagging requests in `TODO.md` with the relevant current-code findings and dependencies.
- No app behavior or deck data changed in this task.

### 2026-07-25 — Persistent Codex/Claude handoff

- Commit `a58c930`.
- Added this ledger, linked it from `CLAUDE.md`, and added root `AGENTS.md` instructions so both Claude and future Codex chats discover and preserve the same handoff.
- Reconstructed the Codex work in this conversation from the committed git history rather than relying on the chat's compressed context.

### 2026-07-25 — Reverse-direction SpanishDict protection

- Commits `16955dc`, `be52ef3`; front-end cache `flashcards-v75` / `20260725t`.
- Fixed `sea` being offered Spanish translations of the English noun *sea*. A legacy cache record had been fetched in the wrong dictionary direction while the corpus token was the Spanish conjugation of `ser`.
- Added a conservative conjugation-aware replacement in `build_menu_analyses()`: it requires a known non-self conjugation lemma, no usable matching lemma analysis, and a majority of Spanish-looking glosses before replacing the legacy self-headword with the cached lemma analysis.
- Added invalidation support and targeted rebuild behavior; corrected normal, Bad Bunny, Rosalía, Young Miko, and shared-master outputs.
- Verification: `pipeline/test_util_5c_guard.py` covers 22 cases, including `sea → ser`, while retaining valid homographs `vino → wine` and `baila → spotted sea bass`.

### 2026-07-25 — Front-card morphology and pooled examples

- Commits `51f77bd`, `cae174c`; caches advanced through the v73/v74 sequence.
- Made morphology consistently English and reordered labels so person/number leads the grammatical mood/tense detail.
- In Merge Lemmas mode, examples pooled from sibling forms highlight the form actually present in the lyric rather than only the host card surface.

### 2026-07-25 — Stable levels, sets, and progress

- Commits `9a011a7`, `94bdeaa`, `def2f94`, `5b3f96d`, `21768e7`, `f3cb882`.
- Unified setup and in-study controls, made frequency levels finishable, introduced stable discrete study sets, and added partial-level progress indicators.
- Set boundaries remain stable across Merge Lemmas/Cognates filtering so preference changes do not move cards into a different numbered set.

### 2026-07-25 — Card-back metadata cleanup

- Commit `4588ac4`.
- Removed rank and occurrence metadata from the back and suppressed trivial plural/elision surface-form notes, retaining non-obvious canonical-form information.

### 2026-07-24 — Card grammar and sense/example presentation

- Commits `0143c2f`, `1351d42`, `2649ab2`, `5bd7093`, `0658c92`, `270b69c`, `3902737`, `2920fc3`, `5cb5632`, `0cfe7ff`, `5f7eaf0`, `80cd9cb`.
- Added the active setup-step pulse, highlighted “used with X” context terms, grouped senses by POS, visually linked assigned senses to examples, then refined the layout into the current POS-linked grammar system.
- Removed redundant matched/matched-sentence and Expressions/Clitics pills during the refinements; split multi-POS front pills and tied morphology styling to VERB.

### 2026-07-24 — Language/setup presentation

- Commits `3f2a6e9`, `34cf23f`, `4a9bf8e`, `29bbc61`, `c92d0f0`, `bcbe509`, `bdfa03b`, `cd040cf`.
- Renamed Collapse Lemmas to Merge Lemmas, shortened Cognates labels, brightened active-study progress, preserved Lemma/Cognates help in artist mode, reused the radial picker for normal-mode languages, and folded standard progress into the language step.

### 2026-07-24 — Lemma pooling and frequency design

- Commits `1196e94`, `e4364aa`, `44e4d3f`, `cf59df5`.
- Audited and fixed lemma sibling pooling so card-front corpus frequency uses the same pooled basis as examples.
- Reworked smart frequency partitioning after the pooling fix to improve useful resolution in the artist long tail.

### 2026-07-24 — Artist corpus and deck rebuild

- Commits `7c63853`, `8b5df27`, `26a7c32`, `1d710a5`, `56f6a27`, `b32e34e`, `6147581`.
- Excluded exact repeated lyric lines from corpus counts, backfilled missing verb conjugation tables, rebuilt the three Spanish artist decks/shared master, and reconciled the Spotify desktop-confirmation backlog item.

### 2026-07-24 — Backlog capture and reconciliation

- Commits `edb9b38`, `f648ba3`, `360d9d7`, `dc0c3a9`.
- Captured the Notes-app backlog and judgment-dependent dependencies in `TODO.md`, then reconciled the smaller completed items against the implemented state.
